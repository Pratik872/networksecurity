# Network Security System using ML, Github Actions, Dagshub, MLFlow and Docker

## Overview
- This is a phising dataset having features such as 'having_IP_addres', 'URL Length', 'Favicon', 'Port', etc. This was downloaded from web and was pushed into MongoDb Atlas which was used for ingestion into pipeline at later stage

- The dataset has more than 11000 records has about 20+ features.

## Motivation
- This problem deadls with cybersecurity which is a necessity in today's generation.

- I tried to implement ML into this domain

## Methodology

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- I have plotted various graphs to visualize the data. Some of them are as follows :

![PriceVsStops](https://github.com/Pratik872/ML/blob/main/E2E%20Project/FlightFarePredictor/readme_resources/StopsVsPrice.png)

- Required Graphs are plotted using seaborn,matplotlib libraries.

- Also heatmap is plotted for checking the corelation between target and predictor variables.

### Feature Engineering
- I have derived many useful features from existing features so that I can use them in my model. You can check the notebook attached.

- I have handled categorical variables i.e nominal ar well as ordinal by using one-hot-encoding and label encoding whereever necessary.

### Feature Selection
- I have used ExtraTreesRegressor for checking feature importances.

- I have also used barplot for visualising them:

### Model Making

- I have built a RandomForestRegressor model with default hyperparameters initially.

- I chose this model just because I thought ensemble model would work better. But you can try different models too.

### Hyper-Parameter Tuning

- I have tuned the hyperparameters 'n_estimators', 'max_depth', 'max_features' by using RandomisedSearchCV. I used  this because this works faster than GridSearchCV.

- I again built a RF model with best hyper-parameters selected from CV.

### Metrics

- I have used 'r2_score' as my metric here. You can use any different metric for regression.

- Further I have plotted and checked error terms also to check whether they are normally distributed around 0.
