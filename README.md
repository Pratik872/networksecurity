# Network Security System using ML, Github Actions, Dagshub, MLFlow and Docker

## Overview
- This is a phising dataset having features such as 'having_IP_addres', 'URL Length', 'Favicon', 'Port', etc. This was downloaded from web and was pushed into MongoDb Atlas which was used for ingestion into pipeline at later stage

- The dataset has more than 11000 records has about 20+ features.

## Motivation
- This problem deadls with cybersecurity which is a necessity in today's generation.

- I tried to implement an end to end ML pipeline with modular programming as used in industry level.
